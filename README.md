Hi, I'm Terra, a systems-focused developer.

I design modular, observable, and evolvable infrastructures across simulation, AI, and runtime environments.

I think in terms of process isolation, versioned interfaces, and execution environments that can be inspected, sandboxed, and extended. Whether I'm creating a multitasking shell, a policy-aware AI, or a fictional magic system with biological cost, my design goal remains the same: clarity, control, and continuity.

I believe systems should explain themselves. I build not for speed, but for structural longevity.
